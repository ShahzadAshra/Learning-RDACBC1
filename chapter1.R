  Vectors
  Lists
  Matrices
  Arrays

#Vector
# create a vector 
apple <- c('red','green','yelloe')
print(apple)
#get the class of the vector created
print(class(apple))

#List
#list is an R object which can contain different types of elements inside
#like vectors functions, and even an other list
#Create a list
list1 <- list(c(2,5,3), 21.3, sin)
print(list1)

#Matrix
#A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set.
#It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.
M <- matrix(c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)

#Arrays
#While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions.
#The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension.
# Create an array.
a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(2,2,2))
print(a)

# factors
#Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector.
#It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels.
#The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc.in the input vector.
#They are useful in statistical modeling.

#Data Frames
#Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data.
#The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical.
#It is a list of vectors of equal length.
#Data Frames are created using the data.frame() function.

# Create the data frame.
